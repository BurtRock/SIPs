Have a PnL of 10% on their total portfolio (minimum of 1k sUSD) in either direction.
(Eventually, Copy Trade someone for 100 sUSD for minimum of 24 hours)
Join Discord and verify authenticity.

The current bounty is 1 KWENTA for completing this list however note that this checklist and the reward can be freely updated by a majority vote in the Elite Council at any time. Withdrawing from the 1k sUSD deposit erases their progress from completing the above list. withdrawal nulls this score. Min expectation is a deposit of 1k, 10 trades, 10% gain or loss. 1 KWENTA will be available for each trader within a cap of 1% of all monthly inflation, once this cap is reached all traders will be diluted proportionally to all the users who joined in the affected month.
