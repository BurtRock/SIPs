## Summary

This proposal outlines a model in which the KWENTA token will be distributed to the community once launched. 

## Abstract

5% of KWENTA will be distributed to all Synth traders who have (TBD) and 30% of KWENTA will be distributed to SNX stakers active during Sept 1st 2021 - Feb 1st 2022. The remainder of the KWENTA will be sent to the treasury and distributed according to the model proposed in KIP-4. 

## Motivation

To distribute tokens to community members that are likely to facilitate governance and leverage the token to create a sustainable system for growth. 

## Specification

The distribution will follow this model: 

#### Synth traders 5% 

Synth traders who meet these requirements (TBD) will be distributed the 5% using this method (TBD). The tokens will be distributed evenly across these members and will go into a one-year vesting contract which can be vested at any time, however, an attached fee which will begin at 80% and deplete linearly to 0% after one year will be executed when vested which burns the percentage of tokens exposed to the remaining fee, enabling short term holders to exit while decreasing the total supply. 

Note that shorting is not technically included in this distribution, however, to close a short with the Synthetix system, a wallet would need to make a Synth swap which would would be accounted for in the above distribution model. 


#### SNX Stakers 30% 


SNX stakers active within the range of September 1st 2021 to February 1st 2022 will receive an allotment of 30% of the initial KWENTA supply which will be distributed based on these users' proportion of debt owned during that period (similar to the Aelin distribution). This will include both L1 and L2 stakers. Two-thirds of the KWENTA stakers receive will go into a one-year vesting contract which can be vested at any time, however, an attached fee which will begin at 80% and deplete linearly to 0% after one year will be executed when vested which burns the percentage of tokens exposed to the remaining fee, enabling short term holders to exit while decreasing the total supply. The remaining one-third will be claimable as liquid KWENTA with no vesting period.
