## Summary
This KIP proposes to introduce Trading Rewards to V2 Perps (currently Trading Rewards can only be earned on v1).

## Abstract
This KIP would allow for escrowed Kwenta to be earned for fees generated on trades on V2 Perps.

## Motivation
Earning rewards based on fees paid on V1 perps is a major motivator for traders as it incentivised them use the platform as well as builds loyalty in the long run. Earned Kwenta can be staked and the rewards from staking gives traders an additional incentive as well. 

Currently, these rewards are only earnable on V1 and introducing them on V2 would make V2 usage significantly more enticing for regular traders.

## Specification
Kwenta should enable Trading Rewards on V2. Trading rewards can be higher in the initial stages in order to rewards early V2 users.
