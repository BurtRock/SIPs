## Summary

This proposal requests that funding sent from the Synthetix treasury be forwarded to the Core Contributor Committee to be used for Core Contributor payroll and expenses.

## Request

This request asks that the 2 million sUSD in funding being sent from the Synthetix treasury to the Kwenta treasuryDAO be forwarded to the Core Contributor Committee.

## Rationale

The Core Contributors have requested that the Synthetix Treasury send Kwenta 2 million sUSD in funding to fuel early development of the Kwenta protocol. The funds will be sent to the treasuryDAO from Kwenta incrementally (ex. The first payment included 500,000 sUSD). The Core Contributors would like to request that the entirety of this funding be forwarded to the Core Contributor Committee wallet where it will be used to compensate Core Contributors as well as pay for infrastructure, travel, and other miscellaneous expenses. With the 2 million dollars, the Core Contributors will be able to operate sustainably for a little under 2 years, as outlined in the original SIP (https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-183/).
