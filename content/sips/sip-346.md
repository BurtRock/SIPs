## Simple Summary
Introduce an integrator fee share mechanism for Perps v3, allowing integrators to earn a percentage of protocol fees from trades executed through a Synthetix Perps integration.

## Abstract
This SIP proposes a fee-sharing mechanism for integrators of the Synthetix Perps v3 system. Integrators can earn a share of the protocol fees based on specific criteria, with the potential to qualify for multiple fee categories.

## Motivation
While v2 had a modest fee share program managed by the treasury, this solution came with considerable overhead for the Treasury Council and a poor incentive for frontends which led to several integrators reversing course on their integrations. Finite assets in the treasury also makes fee share in SNX from the treasury an unsustainable model which cannot scale as integrators are more successful at driving volume.

Perps v3 provides an opportunity to create a scalable fee share structure which sustainably incentivizes integrators to share in the upside as the Synthetix protocol grows, as well as providing resources for integrators to invest in growth, marketing, and development to further the ecosystem.

## Specification

### Fee Structure
The integrator fee share will consist of two elements, each configurable via SCCP:

1. **Base Fee:** Set at 15%. Available to all integrations that transmit a unique tracking code.
2. **Ecosystem Contribution Fee:** Set at 5%. Awarded to integrators demonstrating significant contributions to the Synthetix ecosystem. Examples include SNX staking, open-source tool development, or significant investment in Synthetix Perps v3. These are guidelines, and approval will be at the discretion of the Spartan Council based on evidence provided.

Each fee is additive, meaning an integrator can qualify for both fees, a total of 20% of feesPaid when their tracking code is used.

### Eligibility
Eligibility for the Public Interface Fee and the Ecosystem Contribution Fee will be determined through the SCCP process. Integrators will submit an SCCP detailing their qualifications based on the criteria and the associated tracking codes and Ethereum addresses.

### Regular Reviews
Reviews are expected once per epoch, focusing on:

1. Evaluating the overall fee share structure's effectiveness.
2. Assessing each integrator's adherence to their original SCCP.

Integrators receiving the Ecosystem Contribution Fee should be evaluated to determine if the eligibility criteria described in their original SCCPs are still considered to be valuable contributions to the ecosystem, and ensure that integrators are operating as described.

Following this review, Spartan Council should appoint a member to formally propose changes to each integrator's fee share based on the findings of the review. Integrators should be informed of recommended changes to allow additional information to be provided.

## Review Template

| Integrator | Original Eligibility Consideration - Ecosystem Contribution | Adherence Review - Ecosystem Contribution | Additional Developments | New Total Fee Share |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Example    | Yes                                                        | Developed open-source tools                   | Introduced new features | 20%                  |

## Technical Specification
- **Base Fee:** Directly linked to the unique tracking code transmitted by the integrator.
- **Ecosystem Contribution Fee:** Determined on a case-by-case basis, with examples including SNX staking, open-source tool development, or significant investment in Synthetix Perps v3.

## Rationale
The integrator fee share aims to incentivize and reward integrators for their contributions to the Synthetix ecosystem. A 3-part fee share structure provides a baseline incentive to integrate with Synthetix Perps, but additional incentives for use cases which are likely to scale or provide additional lasting value to the ecosystem, encouraging integrators to participate in the governance process, be available for community feedback, and contribute additional value to the Synthetix ecosystem beyond the integration.

Establishing precedent for use of the Ecosystem Contribution Fee through integrator proposed SCCPs empowers integrators to propose novel ecosystem contributions, but keeps governance engagement to a minimum by only evaluating new use cases when they are proposed rather than attempting to anticipate and evaluate all possible contributions in this SIP. In practice, it is likely that early SCCPs set precedent for use of the Ecosystem Contribution Fee and later integrators will follow an established path.

The review process, while adding some governance overhead, is a reasonable process for governance to assess the impact of the fee share program and adjust as needed. At this early stage, itâ€™s likely that governance should be collecting as much information as possible and staying actively engaged with integrators, so epochal reviews likely add little additional overhead vs the current expectation for governance, but do provide a framework by which to evaluate fee share moving forward.
